            <h3>Intended Use</h3>
            <p>
                It is my (the creator of GutCheck's) hope that users who care about upholding the truth will contribute to a civil discourse on
                this platform by providing posts with thoughtfully formed opinions backed up by reputable
                sources with the aim of discrediting misinformation on the internet. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>What is not allowed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Inaccuracy:</b> Posts that are deterined to be blatantly inaccurate or backed up by faulty evidence will be removed.
                    I will thoroughly consider accusations of inaccuracy and will thoroughly reserach the matter before commiting to post removal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Vulgarity:</b> Posts engaging in vulgarity will be removed. This platform is intended exclusively for civil discourse.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Hate Speech:</b> Posts that contain hate speech will be removed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Bullying:</b> Posts that contain bullying will be removed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Malicious URLs:</b> Posts containing malicious URLs pose a threat to other users and will be removed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h3>Further Consequences of Breaking Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to the post removal processes described above, if a user engages in 
                hate speech, bullying, or malicious URL activity, all their account data will
                be deleted, and the user's email will be banned permanently. These 3 categories consistently stem from the direct goal to hurt others, 
                and that sort of behavior will not be tolerated on this platform.
